								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">Accessory SDK allows you to connect accessory devices to Samsung smart devices. With Accessory SDK, you can define a new service between the accessory and smart device, enabling you to use the various smart device functions from the accessory device. The service is compatible with various connectivity environments, which makes accessory development efficient and convenient.</p>
								
								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">Accessory SDK adds new functions to the service as Samsung smart devices improve. Future updates will enable the accessory and the smart device to exchange more information and support more interworking.</p>
								<!-- img_c -->

								</div><!-- //img_c -->

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">The Samsung Accessory Eco-system consists of Samsung smart devices and accessory devices which use the Accessory SDK. Samsung smart devices are equipped with the Samsung Accessory Service Framework, which supports various accessory services. Accessory devices use the framework to interwork with Samsung smart devices.</p>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">The Accessory SDK provides a single protocol that supports multiple connectivity technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth classic, and BLE (Bluetooth v4.0). The Samsung Accessory Service Framework supports service discovery that is independent of the connectivity technology, and establishes connections between applications for data exchange. You do not need technical knowledge of each connectivity model to develop Accessory services.</p>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">Accessory devices communicate with Samsung smart devices through the various connectivity channels supported by the devices. Samsung smart devices can be connected to many accessory devices to implement services in applications. Establishing a connection between the Samsung smart device and an accessory device allows the latter to offer additional functions supported by the Samsung smart device.</p>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">You can use the Accessory SDK to:</p>

								<ul class="sd2_con_list sd2_oneline">
									<li><p>Control the smart device remotely (for example, controlling music volume)</p></li>
									<li><p>Provide notification relay or alarm</p></li>
									<li><p>Find the smart device</p></li>
								</ul>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">You can also define and implement your own functionality.</p>

								<h5 class="sd2_body_min_title2">Using Remote Control</h5>
								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">With Accessory SDK, you can listen to music while carrying your smart device in a bag, and at the same time control the music selection and volume with the Gear accessory device on your wrist. Similarly, you can remotely control other smart device features, like the camera.</p>

								<!-- img_c -->
								<div class="sd2_img_c sd2_m_b_25">
									<img src="/images/galaxy/content/SMS_Accessory_02.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Using an accessory device for remote control" />
									<span class="sd2_figure">Figure 2: Using an accessory device for remote control</span>
								</div><!-- //img_c -->

								<h5 class="sd2_body_min_title2">Providing Notification Relay</h5>
								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">The notification relay is a feature that enables you to receive notifications and messages on your smart device remotely (for example, you are walking around the office while your phone is on your desk), by relaying them to your Gear accessory device to let you know that something is going on.</p>

								<!-- img_c -->

								</div><!-- //img_c -->

								<h5 class="sd2_body_min_title2">Finding the Device</h5>
								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">The Accessory SDK provides the “Find My Phone” feature, which allows you to use an accessory device to find your smart device.</p>

								<!-- img_c -->
								<div class="sd2_img_c sd2_m_b_25">
									<img src="/images/galaxy/content/SMS_Accessory_04.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Locating the device with the accessory" />

								</div><!-- //img_c -->

								<h5 class="sd2_body_min_title2">What Is Accessory File Transfer SDK?</h5>
								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">Accessory File Transfer SDK allows you to transfer files between devices using any type of connectivity supported by the Samsung Accessory Service Framework. You can, for example, develop applications that record a voice memo and send it to the smart device (for example, the Voice Memo application on the Gear sends the recorded memo to the Galaxy Note 3 device).</p>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">The Accessory File Transfer SDK contains the Accessory File Transfer Service, which enables file transfer between smart devices that use and connect via Samsung Accessory Service Framework. Since Accessory File Transfer Service requires the Samsung Accessory Service Framework for the actual file transfer, the service can only be used in applications that also have the Accessory SDK. With Accessory File Transfer, you can send files of any size over all connectivity types supported by the Samsung Accessory Service Framework.</p>

								<h5 class="sd2_body_min_title2">Restrictions</h5>

								<p class="sd2_paragraph01">Accessory SDK has the following restrictions</p>

								<ul class="sd2_con_list sd2_oneline sd2_mb_25">
									<li><p>Accessory SDK only supports the GALAXY Gear (from January 2014 version), Samsung Gear 2, Samsung Gear 2 Neo, Samsung Gear S, and Samsung Gear S2.</p></li>
									<li><p>Both the smart and accessory device must have the Samsung Accessory Service Framework installed.</p></li>
									<li><p>Devices with Android 4.3 or higher support Accessory SDK (since they are equipped with the Samsung Accessory Service Framework).</p></li>
								</ul>

									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><em>2.2</em><p>Licensee acknowledges and agrees that an Application must satisfy SAMSUNG’s technical standards before it can be tested on the relevant SAMSUNG product pursuant to SAMSUNG’s internal quality assessment process. SAMSUNG reserves the right to reject any Application at its sole discretion. SAMSUNG’s testing of an Application shall not be construed as Samsung’s approval on the Application on any aspect. If a material change is made to the Application, Licensee must submit the revised version for SAMSUNG’s approval.</p></li>
								<li><em>2.3</em><p>Licensee must ensure that the SAMSUNG copyright disclaimers and other proprietary notices that appear in the SDK and Documentation are retained and reproduced in full in all copies of the SDK and Documentation that Licensee makes as permitted under this Agreement.</p></li>

								<li><em>2.5 </em><p>Licensee must not exploit the SDK in any unauthorized way, including but not limited to, by way of trespass or burdening network capacity. Any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of the rights of SAMSUNG and licensors of the SDK. </p></li>

								<li><em>2.10</em><p>SAMSUNG has no obligation to provide any maintenance, technical or other support in respect of the SDK.</p></li>
								<li><em>2.11</em><p>If the Application is distributed, offered, resold, or licensed ("Distribute") under the white-labeling of a third party, SAMSUNG may object to such Distribution if SAMSUNG deems the Distribution adversely affects SAMSUNG's business.

										<li>(h) If an Application includes any Third Party Software, Licensee must comply with all licensing terms applicable to such Third Party Software. However, Licensee shall separate the portion of the Third Party Software from the portion of the SDK in Licensee’s Application and shall not cause the portion of the SDK in Licensee’s Application, any derivative works thereof, and/or SAMSUNG’s Confidential Information to be subject to the licensing terms applicable to such Third Party Software (e.g., public disclosure, public distribution).
