								<li><em>10.6</em><p>No Waiver. <br />Failure by SAMSUNG to insist upon strict performance of any of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in no way constitute a waiver of SAMSUNG’s rights as set forth in this Agreement, at law or in equity, or a waiver of any other provisions or the right to take action in respect of a subsequent default by Licensee in the performance or compliance with any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p></li>
								<li><em>10.7</em><p> Remedies. <br />Licensee acknowledges that any disclosure, use or misappropriation of Confidential Information of SAMSUNG in violation of this Agreement would cause SAMSUNG irreparable harm for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Licensee agrees that SAMSUNG shall have the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief and specific performance, without prejudice to any remedies otherwise available to SAMSUNG at law or in equity.</p></li>

The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties. Except to the extent entry of judgment and any subsequent enforcement may require disclosure, all matters relating to the arbitration, including the award, shall be held in confidence.</p></li>
